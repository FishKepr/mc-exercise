Merge Conflict Exercise

Bob did not perform a “git pull origin master” to ensure that his local computer was up to date with the master branch on GitHub. When Bob attempted to “A-C-P” and then do a pull request, there were merge conflicts that needed to be resolved. The master branch is now updated with Bob and Carols changes(which Ted and Alice did not have). Ted and Alice were able to successfully “A-C-P” to their branch, but when they attempted to merge with master, they also had merge conflicts that needed to be resolved.

We believe that if the four of them would have coordinated their workflow better they would not have encountered any merge conflicts.
